Hey, you've made it! ðŸŽ‰ The journey through the world of front-end development has shown us many different aspects: composing components, writing tests, adding type safety, managing state, handling errors, optimizing for performance, etc. 

In the final part of this module, you'll build your front-end capstone project. The goal is to apply the knowledge and skills gained from the web development program and this front-end specialization module. The capstone project is an excellent opportunity to challenge yourself, fill in the knowledge gaps, and create a potentially great portfolio item for a showcase.

**Please note:** the next sprint will detail your next steps as you complete the course and does not contain additional learning material or graded projects 

Good luck! ðŸš€

## Project description

The primary focus of the front-end capstone project is to build a front-end-oriented web application using React.

The project does not set a particular theme, so you can think of an idea for the project and start from scratch or continue building on top of the previous capstone projects. Additionally, you can use previous graded projects from this module. However, you must explicitly specify if your front-end capstone project is based on a previous one. Please do so to ensure a successful project review and avoid a severe grade reduction.

## Requirements

Since the front-end capstone project does not have a theme, we have not provided any functional requirements. You will decide what functionality your application will have.

### General Requirements

* The project can be a fresh idea started from scratch or based on previous graded and capstone projects.
* If building on top of an existing project, you must disclose it as part of the submission and inform the reviewer beforehand.
* If building on top of a previous graded project, you are still required to think of your own unique functionality and ideas. More than implementing previously specified bonus challenges is needed.
* Prepare comprehensive documentation describing the project: how it works, how to set it up, etc.
* You are expected to plan your work and apply Agile methodologies where possible.
* The project should be realistic and have the potential to be used in the real world.

### Technical Requirements

* Must use React as a standalone or with a framework such as Next.js.
* There must be an integration or interaction with the back-end using REST APIs, WebSocket, etc.
* You are not expected to write back-end code, but you can choose to build a full-stack project as long as the focus remains on the front-end.
* If the project contains back-end code or other dependencies unrelated to the front-end stack, such as databases, it should be straightforward for the reviewers to set them up. You may consider using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) for such cases.
* TypeScript usage is mandatory.
* The front-end code must be covered with some tests, ideally with a combination of unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.
* The application must pass [Web Core Vitals](https://web.dev/articles/vitals) metrics (values should be within the `good` and `needs improvement` range, but NOT in the `poor` range). Exceptions apply if a sufficient reason is provided, such as an external API being very slow, etc.

## Tips & Suggestions

* If it's challenging to come up with a project idea:
	* Look for product and application inspiration:
		* [ProductHunt](https://www.producthunt.com)
		* [Hacker News Show HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/show)
	* Browse through job position ads. Job ads usually describe what a company does, what sort of products and services it offers, etc. You can use the opportunity to create a project in a matching domain area, such as finance or e-commerce. Your capstone project can become a portfolio piece that can help you get a job offer!
	* Focus on solving a real problem or need that you or someone you know has. You can also align your hobbies, interests, and passions with the project. This way, ideas for what features to build in your application will come more naturally.

* The reviewer will not directly evaluate the design and UX decisions, but extra polish and details can go a long way to building a more substantial overall impression. Therefore, try creating an application that is pleasant and easy to use.
* Think about the must-haves, should-haves, could-haves in your application. What features and functionality are a *must* to have for the application to have a purpose? What *should* be added later? What *could* be added if you had some extra time?
* If you are considering an unusual project, such as creating a browser extension, note that all the technical requirements (React, TypeScript usage, tests, performance, etc.) and evaluation criteria still apply.

## Reviewer Role

You will need to present the project as if you're presenting to a team of people with different disciplines. Imagine the team consists of developers, a product designer, a product manager/owner, a technical lead, etc. You will be expected to describe the project idea, present the implementation from the user's perspective, and explain the technical decisions and implementation.

The reviewer will ask primarily technical questions but be ready to discuss UI/UX, edge cases, the scope of the project, and other topics. The reviewer may also ask questions to check your knowledge of the module's learning material.



### Notes for the Reviewer

* If the learner informs you that they are building on top of a previous project, you should expect a higher level of complexity and integration of new concepts from this module.

* You should ask which features are new and which are carried over from the previous project. You can also ask for the previous project's repository link to verify the learner's claims.

**Example of questions for the reviewer to ask**:

* What are the key features of your application?
* What has been the most challenging part of the implementation?
* If you could do this project again, what would you do differently and why?
* How did you decide which parts of the application to test? If given more time, what tests would you add?
* What was our thought process and plan when working on this project? Did you work in iterations incrementally?
* What are the most important things you've learned during this project?

## Project Evaluation Criteria

* **Project Presentation & Documentation**. The learner was well-prepared to present the project idea and showcase the functionality, technical decisions, and implementation. The documentation is sufficient and includes a good overview of the project and setup instructions.
* **Functionality & Purpose**. The project fulfills its intended purpose and solves a problem that could be useful in a real-world scenario.
* **Code Quality**. The codebase is clean and does not contain boilerplate or unused code. Modules, components, utilities, and other parts of the code are well structured and organized, and common good coding practices are followed.
* **Application Correctness & Tests**. The application has been well tested (manually and using automated tests), and there are no major bugs. Errors are handled gracefully.
* **Performance**. The application is performant, passes Core Web Vitals, and does not contain unnecessary optimizations that have little effect.
* **General Knowledge**. The learner has no issues answering questions about their project, technologies, and potential solutions for proposed problems. The learner understands the topics and concepts learned in this module.
